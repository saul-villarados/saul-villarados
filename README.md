## Hi, I'm Saul 👋

- 🐍 While my main stack is Python, SQL, DVC, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and CI/CD, I'm always eager to explore and learn other technologies.
- 🤖 My core work involves developing Gen AI solutions for content understanding, building forecasting models, and advancing MLOps/infrastructure.
- 📝 Through my new [**Medium Blog**](https://medium.com/@saul.villarados), I share insights on data science, machine learning, productivity, and personal development.
- 👨‍💻 While I actively develop new projects daily, limits on sharing work-related code exist. Thus, my public repositories reflect smaller-scale or earlier explorations.
